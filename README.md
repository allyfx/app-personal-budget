<h1 align="center">💰 Personal Budget</h1>
<p>Using Html5, BootStrap and JavaScript (ES6), I made an application where we can add and remove new expenses, and these will be saved in the browser's Local Storage.</p>

<h3>💡 How it works</h3>
<p>In the index.html file, we can add new expenses. As soon as the add button is pressed, the JavaScript code will run. In JavaScript, expense objects will be created and these objects will be saved in the browser's Local Storage. When the query.html page is launched, it will search Local Storage for expense objects and display them on the page.</p>
